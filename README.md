### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh, and I've operated as a senior full-stack developer for the past 10 years. Combined with my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, those years have allowed me to build skills as a full-stack developer, specializing in React & React Native. I really love my work and that passion is reflected in the quality of my code.

Tech Stacks:
- React, Angular, Vue, Next, Node, Express, Tailwind, Material, Bootstrap, jQuery
- React Native
- RESTful API, GraphQL, 3rd party API integration
- MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL

I am a proven troubleshooter who works well with other team members and I have worked with Agile Development, building test-driven code both as a developer and as a scrum master.
